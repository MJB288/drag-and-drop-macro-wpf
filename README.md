# drag-and-drop-macro-wpf

This is intended to be a small project to play around with the WPF library. This is not intended to compete with any existing solutions that are available, just simply be a learning project to expand my knowledge of C# UI libraries.

The overall vision is to have a window where you can create a macro by dragging and dropping keys and delays and loop requests. There are some unknowns, I know WPF is capable of dragging and dropping, but since I've never done a project with drag and drop, I don't know if it can handle the extent I want to go.
